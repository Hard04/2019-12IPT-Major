    	<h2>Weapons</h2> 
		<p>Weapons are essential items used for combat against enemies, bosses, and even other players during PvP games. They typically deal more damage than their tool counterparts. Some weapons can be crafted at a Work Bench or a Pre-Hardmode/Hardmode Anvil, while others can only be found in Chests, as enemy drops, or purchased from NPCs. Terraria has a wide variety of weapons and weapons classes, each suited to particular play styles or specific tasks.</p>
		<p>There are 8 types of damage:</p>
	</div>
<!--///Melee///	-->
<!--<div class="box">
<h3><a href="Melee.html">Melee</a></h3>
	<p>Melee weapons are non-magic striking weapons that are used in close-to-medium ranged combat. The defining trait of melee weapons is the fact that they don't consume ammunition or mana upon use. Melee weapons include Swords, Spears, Flails, Boomerangs, Yoyos, and other weapons which can be reused indefinitely without restriction.</p>
</div>
<button class="accordion">Pre-Hardmode Swords</button>
<div class="panel">
   	<p>Swords are melee weapons which can be divided into 2 basic categories: Shortswords, and Broadswords. Shortswords have a very limited range and attack with a horizontal stabbing motion instead of an arc. Broadswords are swung overhead, which makes it easier to defeat flying and jumping enemies than shortswords.</p>

<!--Ranged///

<!--
<div class="box">
<h3><a href="ranged.html">Ranged</a></h3>
<p>Ranged weapons are weapons that generally require ammo to operate and can attack from a distance. Most ranged weapons are split into the broad categories of bows / repeaters, guns and launchers. Note that Terraria classifies Boomerangs as Melee weapons and consumables as Throwing weapons instead as well as that generally for ranged weapons, the total damage and knockback values in effect during use are actually a product of the weapon stats shown here combined with those of the ammunition type used. A ranged weapon with a knockback value of zero, for example, will still usually apply some knockback, since nearly all ammunition types have their own knockback values.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Pre-Hardmode Bows</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Bows are ranged weapons that fire arrows as ammunition. Although several Bows deal no knockback, the arrows do (with the exception of the Bone Arrow and Heart Arrow).</p>

</div>

<button class="accordion">(Hardmode) Repeaters</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Repeaters are Hardmode ranged weapons that can be considered upgrades to bows. All repeaters fire arrows, but not in the case of the Stake Launcher, where a different type of ammunition similar to arrows is used. Unlike bows, they can be fired repeatedly. They strongly resemble repeating crossbows.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Pre-Hardmode Guns</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Guns are ranged weapons that fire bullets. In addition to ranged bonuses, guns also benefit from the Shroomite Mask, and are compatible with the Rifle Scope. Possession of any gun (or bullets) fulfills the criteria for the Arms Dealer NPC to appear. Several other items are referred to as "Guns" in-game, but none of these fire bullets or gain the above bonuses related to guns, nor will they cause the Arms Dealer to spawn.</p>

<button class="accordion">(Hardmode) Launchers</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>Launchers are a variety of Hardmode ranged weapons that fire Rockets. While all use the same ammunition, each delivers munitions in varied ways. Rockets generally explode on contact with an enemy or solid block, dealing heavy damage within the area of the explosion. They can often damage the player if not fired carefully. All Launchers benefit from the damage bonus of the Shroomite Helmet, as well as other Ranged bonuses. They can only be obtained post-Plantera.</p>
</div>

<button class="accordion">Pre-Hardmode Others (Ranged)</button>
<div class="panel">
	<p>These weapons fall under the category of ranged, but don't use normal ammunition. They use Seeds, Flares, Sand, Snow(balls), Fallen stars, or no ammunition at all! (this applies to: Slime Gun, Water Gun, Harpoon and Paintball Gun).</p>

<div class="box">
<h3><a href="magic.html">Magic</a></h3>
<p>Magic weapons are weapons that use Mana, a resource that regenerates. They can produce several different types of attacks, many of which are more unusual, rather than simply firing a directed projectile, which makes them more capable of unexpected or strategic attacks. They are notably more subtle than melee and summon, requiring more strategy than head on combat.</p>

	<p>Wands are magic weapons which use Mana, a regenerating reasource. They can produce several different types of attacks, many of which are unusual, rather than simply a projectile. This type of weapon is more sublte than melee, requiring more strategy than head on combat.
	Types of Pre-Hardmode wands include:<br><br>
	
	- Gem staves: A Gem staff is a magic weapon that fires a brightly glowing projectile that travels at medium speed (the 4 highest-tier Gem staves can also pierce up to 2 enemies). There are currently 7 types corresponding to the 7 different mineable Gems. They are crafted from Gems and Bars at the Iron Anvil or Lead Anvil. <br>- Controlable projectile: Projectiles you can control with your cursor, e.g. the Flamelash and Magic missile.<br> - Common Projectile: Projectiles you cannot control once you activate them, e.g. Wand of sparking, Flower of Fire, Vilethorn and Aqua Scepter. <br>- Simple Summoning: Creates a stationary effect zone, e.g. The Crimson rod.</p>

<h3><a href="summoning.html">Summoning</a></h3>
<p>Summon weapons are a type of weapon that spawns secondary characters that will aid during battle by automatically attacking enemies within range. They cannot be damaged or killed, and deal summon damage. Summon weapons come in two different categories:</p>
<li><a href="Minions.html">Minions</a></li>
<li><a href="Sentries.html">Sentries</a></li>
<p>Additionally, the set bonuses of the Stardust armor and Forbidden armor etc. will summon an entity to fight for the player in a manner similar to minions, although they do not fall into either of the categories above.</p>
